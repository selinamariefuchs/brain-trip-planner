Fix BrainTrip so it generates REAL travel spots for the selected city and AI-generated trivia that is balanced (not too easy, not too hard). Do not keep placeholder/generic suggestions like “City Center” or “Main Park”.

REQUIREMENTS (Must)
1) REAL ITINERARY SUGGESTIONS
- Suggestions must be real, named places (e.g., “Millennium Park”, “Art Institute of Chicago”, “Wicker Park”, “Chicago Riverwalk”), not generic categories.
- Implement a “grounded suggestions” pipeline:
  A) Fetch real POIs using a Places data source (preferred: Google Places API OR Foursquare OR OpenTripMap — choose one and implement cleanly).
  B) For each POI, store: placeId, name, address/vicinity, lat, lng, type/category.
  C) Then call AI ONLY to generate: a 1–2 sentence description + a 1-sentence fun fact for each real POI (do not let AI invent POI names).
- Deduplicate POIs by placeId and normalize categories.
- If no API key is set, use a small curated fallback list per city (NYC/Chicago/Paris/Rome/Tokyo) with REAL places, not generic placeholders.

2) DISTANCES FROM HOTEL (Already have hotel input)
- Distance should be calculated correctly (no crazy numbers like 965 km in the same city).
- Geocode hotel to lat/lng once, cache it for the trip.
- Use Haversine for instant distance. (Optional: later add drive ETA, but not required.)
- If hotel is blank or geocode fails, show “Distance unavailable”.
- Cache distances by (hotelLatLng + placeId) so repeat loads are fast.

3) TRIVIA MUST BE AI-GENERATED AND BALANCED
- Trivia questions + 4 multiple-choice options + correct index + fun fact must be AI generated.
- Only TWO difficulty levels: “Standard” and “Challenge” (remove any third level).
- Standard: interesting but not obscure.
- Challenge: deeper facts but not trick questions.
- Enforce quality rules:
  - options length == 4
  - options unique
  - correctIndex 0–3
  - distractors plausible (no obviously fake answers)
  - funFact is 1 sentence, non-empty
- Add a validation pass: if any question fails validation, regenerate once; if still failing, use curated fallback questions for that city.

4) NO USER GETS THE SAME QUESTION TWICE
- Implement per-user question uniqueness:
  - Create a stable questionId = hash(city + difficulty + questionText).
  - Store seenQuestionIds per user (and optionally per city) in persistent storage (localStorage/Preferences or DB if present).
  - When generating a new quiz, exclude seenQuestionIds: regenerate/replace any duplicates until the quiz contains all unseen questions.
  - Keep a cap: if uniqueness cannot be satisfied after N attempts, expand pool by requesting more questions from AI and filtering.
- Make this robust even if user is logged out (use a local anonymous user id stored in storage).

5) MATCH CITY SELECTION CORRECTLY
- Ensure the city user selects is what is used for both:
  - Places/POIs search
  - Trivia generation
- Add a sanity check: if POI results are not in/near the selected city, discard and refetch with tighter parameters (city center lat/lng bounding or “+ city, country” query).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS (Preferred)
- Put all external API calls on the server (Express):
  - POST /api/places/search { city, categories, limit }
  - POST /api/trivia/generate { city, difficulty, count, excludeQuestionIds[] }
  - POST /api/poi/enrich { city, poiList[] } (AI writes descriptions/fun facts ONLY from given POI names)
- Keep secrets in env vars only.
- Add caching layer:
  - cache POI results by city+categories for 24h
  - cache hotel geocode by hotel string
  - cache distances by hotelLatLng+placeId
  - cache trivia questions by city+difficulty (but respect excludeQuestionIds)

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (Must pass)
- For Chicago, the app shows at least 5 real named places.
- Trivia correct answer is not always A; answer distribution is varied.
- If user plays again for the same city+difficulty, at least 80% of questions are new until the pool is exhausted.
- Distances are realistic (e.g., 0–20 miles within Chicago) and not hundreds of km.
- No blank screens; errors show friendly messages and allow retry.

DELIVERABLES
- List files changed + explain the new data flow.
- Show how uniqueness is enforced and where questionIds are stored.
- Provide env var names needed for Places + AI (placeholders ok).
Start by inspecting current generation code and replacing placeholder suggestions with grounded POI search + AI enrichment.
