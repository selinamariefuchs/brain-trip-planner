You need to fix the Saved Trips functionality without redesigning the app structure.

ISSUE 1:
When I click a city under "Saved Trips", I should be able to see ALL saved itinerary spots for that specific city.

Currently:
- It either shows incomplete data
- Or does not load properly
- Or does not filter correctly by city

REQUIRED FIX:
- When a user clicks a saved city, navigate to a SavedTripDetail page (or modal).
- That page must:
  - Load all SavedPlace entries filtered by cityId or cityName (must be consistent).
  - Display them in a list with stable keys.
  - Show: name, category/type, notes (if any), savedAt date.
  - Allow delete per item.
  - Handle empty state gracefully (no crash).

Ensure:
- Data is not being overwritten accidentally.
- Saved places persist correctly in localStorage or database.
- No re-renders are clearing state.

ISSUE 2:
From the Saved Trips city page, I should be able to:
1) Continue playing trivia for that same city.
2) Continue adding itinerary spots to that same trip.

REQUIRED FIX:
- Add two buttons at top of SavedTripDetail page:
   - "Continue Trivia"
   - "Add More Spots"

- Continue Trivia:
   - Navigates to Quiz screen
   - Preselects that city automatically
   - Preserves existing trip session if needed

- Add More Spots:
   - Navigates to Suggestions screen
   - Loads suggestions for that same city
   - Appends new spots to existing saved trip instead of creating duplicate trip entries

---

DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Do not create duplicate trips when continuing.
- Ensure tripId or cityId is consistently passed through navigation.
- Use a single source of truth for saved trips.
- Deduplicate saved spots by unique ID or title.

---

UX REQUIREMENTS:
- No blank screens.
- Add loading state if necessary.
- Prevent double-click duplication.
- Maintain scroll performance.

---

After implementing:
1) Show the updated file tree.
2) Explain how tripId and city state are now managed.
3) Confirm no duplicate trip objects are created.
