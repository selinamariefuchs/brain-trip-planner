Fix “Continue Trivia” when launched from Profile → Saved Trips → Trip Detail.

Current bug:
When I open a saved trip and tap “Continue Trivia”, the quiz uses default/generic questions instead of real city-specific Standard questions for that saved trip.

Root cause to address:
This flow likely does not pass/restore the correct trip context (cityLabel, cityPlaceId, difficulty) into the quiz generation call, so the backend falls back.

Requirements:
1) Persist trip identity + context
- Ensure each saved trip has a stable tripId and includes:
  - cityLabel (e.g., “Bangkok, Thailand”)
  - cityPlaceId (Google Places ID for the city)
  - lastSelectedDifficulty ("Standard" or "Challenge") OR default to "Standard"
- When viewing Trip Detail, load the full trip object by tripId (not just city name).

2) Continue Trivia must use the same generator as new trivia
- When user taps “Continue Trivia” in Trip Detail:
  - Navigate to quiz with tripId (and/or cityPlaceId, cityLabel, difficulty)
  - Call POST /api/trivia/generate with:
    { cityPlaceId, cityLabel, difficulty: "Standard"|"Challenge", count, excludeQuestionIds }
  - excludeQuestionIds must include:
    a) user seenQuestionIds for this city+difficulty
    b) questions already asked in this trip (if stored)

3) Remove default trivia path for this flow
- The “Continue Trivia” flow must never call the placeholder/default trivia generator.
- Only fallback if OpenAI fails (429/timeout) AND fallback must still be city-specific using cached cityContext POIs.

4) Fix Standard difficulty tuning
- Standard = easy-to-medium, travel/culture/location-specific.
- Enforce: at least 50% of questions reference POIs from cityContext by name.
- Validate schema/options; regenerate once if invalid.

Deliverables:
- Show exactly which file handles Trip Detail “Continue Trivia” button and what it now passes.
- Show backend endpoint changes to accept cityPlaceId/cityLabel and to avoid default fallback.
- Confirm that continuing trivia for a saved Bangkok trip produces Bangkok-specific questions, not generic defaults.
