Bug: From Profile → Saved Trips → Trip Detail → Continue Trivia, the FIRST time works, but the SECOND time reverts to default settings and returns generic trivia. This must never happen.

ROOT CAUSE TO FIX
The Continue Trivia flow is relying on transient in-memory state (tripContext / screen state) that resets when navigating back and then re-entering. On re-entry, city/difficulty/tripId are missing so generator uses defaults/fallback.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR
- Every time “Continue Trivia” is clicked from a saved trip, the quiz must be generated using the SAME saved trip context (tripId, cityLabel, cityPlaceId, difficulty).
- Never fall back to default city/difficulty/mode for this entry path.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1) Persist and rehydrate activeTripId
- Add persistent storage key: activeTripId
- When user opens a Trip Detail page, set activeTripId = that tripId in storage.
- When Continue Trivia is clicked, navigate with tripId explicitly (route param or screen state), AND set activeTripId again.

2) Rehydrate trip context on quiz start (no reliance on old memory)
- In the quiz start/initialization function:
  - If tripId is provided, load the trip from savedTrips storage/DB using tripId
  - Set:
    trip.cityLabel
    trip.cityPlaceId
    trip.difficulty (default "Standard" if missing)
  - Only after rehydration call /api/trivia/generate.
- If tripId is missing, DO NOT silently default; show an error “Trip not found” and send user back to Saved Trips.

3) Lock difficulty + city for saved-trip continue flow
- Continue Trivia from a saved trip must always use that trip’s stored cityPlaceId + cityLabel.
- Difficulty should default to "Standard" but if the user changed difficulty in that trip, persist it in the trip record and reuse it.

4) Fix caching keys so defaults can’t leak
- Ensure cache key includes cityPlaceId + difficulty:
  trivia:${cityPlaceId}:${difficulty}
- Ensure no cache exists keyed only by "Standard" or only by difficulty.

5) Ensure generator never returns “default trivia” for this path
- In /api/trivia/generate:
  - If request includes tripId or cityPlaceId:
    - NEVER use global default question bank.
    - If OpenAI fails, return a city-specific fallback generated from cached POIs OR return an error requiring retry.
  - Include response metadata: { source: "openai" | "cache" | "fallback", cityPlaceId, difficulty }

6) Add a regression test / log
- Add logs that print when Continue Trivia is pressed:
  CONTINUE_TRIVIA { tripId, cityPlaceId, difficulty }
- Add backend logs:
  TRIVIA_SOURCE + cacheKey
- Verify 2nd click still has same tripId/cityPlaceId and TRIVIA_SOURCE is not “fallback”.

DELIVERABLES
- Show the files changed (Trip Detail page + quiz init + storage + backend trivia endpoint).
- Explain how tripId is persisted and rehydrated.
- Confirm by testing: click Continue Trivia, finish/back, click Continue Trivia again → still generates valid city-specific trivia with correct settings.
